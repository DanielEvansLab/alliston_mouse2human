# Code to generate results

Code to generate results can be found on [github](https://github.com/DanielEvansLab/alliston_mouse2human).

`ext/pre-magma.R` includes functions and demonstrations on how to run them to create snploc, pvalue files, and geneset files for use with MAGMA.

`ext/magma.sh` contains the code used to run MAGMA using the files generated by `pre-magma.R`. Also contains code users can run locally to perform gene-set enrichment analysis using custom geneset files.

`ext/pre-shiny.R` contains the code to assemble the data served by this shiny app from the MAGMA output and mouse-human homology files.
